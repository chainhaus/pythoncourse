Assignment #3

1. Add / modify code ONLY between the marked areas (i.e. "Place code below"). Do not modify or add code elsewhere.
2. Run the associated test harness for a basic check on completeness. A successful run of the test cases does not guarantee accuracy or fulfillment of the requirements. Please do not submit your work if test cases fail.
3. To run unit tests simply use the below command after filling in all of the code:
    python 03_assignment.py
  
4. Unless explicitly stated, please do not import any additional libraries but feel free to use built-in Python packages
5. Submissions must be a Python file and not a notebook file (i.e *.ipynb)
6. Do not use global variables
7. Make sure your work is committed to your master branch in Github
8. Use the test cases to infer requirements wherever feasible

        Create an immutable class Box that has private attributes length and width that takes values for length and width
        upon construction (instantiation via the constructor). Make sure to use Python 3 semantics. Make sure the length
        and width attributes are private and accessible only via getters. Immutable here means that any change to its internal
        state results in a new Box being returned. This means there are no setter methods and any time the internal state
        (length or width) is modified, a new Box is created containing the modified values. 
        This is applicable to combine(), invert() and double()
        
        Good article on immutability: https://towardsdatascience.com/https-towardsdatascience-com-python-basics-mutable-vs-immutable-objects-829a0cb1530a
        
        In addition, create:
        - A method called render() that prints out to the screen a box made with asterisks of length and width dimensions
        - A method called invert() that switches length and width with each other
        - Methods get_area() and get_perimeter() that return appropriate geometric calculations
        - A method called double() that doubles the size of the box. Hint: Pay attention to return value here
        - Implement __eq__ so that two boxes can be compared using ==. Two boxes are equal if their respective lengths and widths are identical.
        - A method print_dim that prints to screen the length and width details of the box
        - A method get_dim that returns a tuple containing the length and width of the box
        - A method combine() that takes another box as an argument and increases the length and width by the dimensions of the box passed in
        - A method get_hypot() that finds the length of the diagonal that cuts throught the middle

        In the function exercise01():
        - Instantiate 3 boxes of dimensions 5,10 , 3,4 and 5,10 and assign to variables box1, box2 and box3 respectively 
        - Print dimension info for each using print_dim()
        - Evaluate if box1 == box2, and also evaluate if box1 == box3, print True or False to the screen accordingly
        - Combine box3 into box1 (i.e. box1.combine()) creating box4
        - Double the size of box2 creating box5
        - Combine box5 into box4 creating box6
        - Using a for loop, iterate through and print the tuple received from calling box2's get_dim()
        - Find the size of the diagonal of box2

    Create a class called MangoDB. The MangoDB class wraps a dictionary of dictionaries. At the the root level, each key/value will be called a collection, similar to the terminology used by MongoDB, an inferior version of MangoDB ;) A collection is a series of 2nd level key/value paries. The root value key is the name of the collection and the value is another dictionary containing arbitrary data for that collection.

    For example:

        {
            'default': {
            'version':1.0,
            'db':'mangodb',
            'uuid':'0fd7575d-d331-41b7-9598-33d6c9a1eae3'
            },
        {
            'temperatures': {
                1: 50,
                2: 100,
                3: 120
            }
        }
    
    The above is a representation of a dictionary of dictionaries. Default and temperatures are dictionaries or collections. The default collection has a series of key/value pairs that make up the collection. The MangoDB class should create only the default collection, as shown, on instantiation including a randomly generated uuid using the uuid4() method and have the following methods:
        - display_all_collections() which iterates through every collection and prints to screen each collection names and the collection's content underneath and may look something like:
            collection: default
                version 1.0
                db mangodb
                uuid 739bd6e8-c458-402d-9f2b-7012594cd741
            collection: temperatures
                1 50
                2 100 
        - add_collection(collection_name) allows the caller to add a new collection by providing a name. The collection will be empty but will have a name.
        - update_collection(collection_name,updates) allows the caller to insert new items into a collection i.e. 
                db = MangoDB()
                db.add_collection('temperatures')
                db.update_collection('temperatures',{1:50,2:100})
        - remove_collection() allows caller to delete a specific collection by name and its associated data
        - list_collections() displays a list of all the collections
        - get_collection_size(collection_name) finds the number of key/value pairs in a given collection
        - to_json(collection_name) that converts the collection to a JSON string
        - wipe() that cleans out the db and resets it with just a default collection
        - get_collection_names() that returns a list of collection names


        Make sure to never expose the underlying data structures

        For exercise02(), perform the following:

        - Create an instance of MangoDB
        - Add a collection called testscores
        - Take the test_scores list and insert it into the testscores collection, providing a sequential key i.e 1,2,3...
        - Display the size of the testscores collection
        - Display a list of collections
        - Display the db's UUID
        - Wipe the database clean
        - Display the db's UUID again, confirming it has changed
