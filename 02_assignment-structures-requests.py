Assignment #2

1. Add / modify code ONLY between the marked areas (i.e. "Place code below")
2. Run the associated test harness for a basic check on completeness. A successful run of the test cases does not 
    guarantee accuracy or fulfillment of the requirements. Please do not submit your work if test cases fail.
3. To run unit tests simply use the below command after filling in all of the code:
    python 07_assignment.py
  
4. Unless explicitly stated, please do not import any additional libraries but feel free to use built-in Python packages
5. Submissions must be a Python file and not a notebook file (i.e *.ipynb)
6. Do not use global variables unless stated to do so
7. Make sure your work is committed to your master branch in Github


Installation requirements:

1. Please install numpy: pip install numpy
